# Faux Market Project

This is a just for fun project to try and make a simple stock market sim website. This however is an actual market sim where buys and sells impact the price of the fake stock. It will have some bots to also trade and try to make money (dumb bots for now)

I'm going to start with a python backend and use basic terminal output to start. Then I will try to make a simple web frontend.
